    "description": "An in-progress total conversion mod for Cataclysm, Dark Days Ahead, intended to rewind the game back to the nineteen thirties and cast the player upon an island in the Arctic Aleutian chain. Originally built and inspired by the work on the original Mythos mod, the packâ€™s mission statement is to turn the game into a depiction of the wider Lovecraft mythos, with creative liberties to suit gameplay and limited, for the time being, to arctic and oceanic elements of the lore.",
